    title: Iciql 1.2.0 released
    id: 1.2.0
    date: 2013-03-25

	html: '''
<span class="alert alert-success">
Iciql artifacts may now be retrieved by your favorite Maven 2-compatible build tool from <a href="http://gitblit.github.com/iciql/maven">here</a>.
</span>
	'''
	
    fixes:
     - Fixed case-sensitivity bug on setting a compound primary key from an annotation (issue 12)
     - Fixed order of DEFAULT value in create table statement (issue 11)
     - Fixed password bug in model generator (issue 7)

    changes:
     - ''
       Support inheriting columns from super.super class, if super.super is annotated.
       This allows for an inheritance hierarchy like:
       @IQTable class MyTable -> @IQView abstract class MyBaseView -> @IQView class MyConstrainedView
       ''

    additions:
     - ''
       Implemented readonly view support. (issue 8)
       View models may be specified using the IQView annotation or Iciql.define().  Views can either be created automatically as part of a query of the view OR views may be constructed from a fluent statement.
       ''
     - Support inheritance of IQVersion for DbUpgrader implementations (issue 10)
	 - Added @IQConstraintForeignKey annotation (issue 13)
	 - Added MS SQL Server dialect (issue 14)

    changes:
     - All bulk operations (insert all, update all, delete all) now use JDBC savepoints to ensure atomicity of the transaction
}

#
# 1.0.0 release
#
r18: {
    title: Iciql 1.0.0 released
    id: 1.0.0
    date: 2012-07-14

    fixes:
     - Fixed bug in using 0L primitive values in where clauses.  These were confused with the COUNT(*) function. (Github/kc5nra,issue 5)

    changes:
     - Issue CREATE TABLE and CREATE INDEX statements once per-db instance/table-mapping

    additions:
     - ''
       Added support for single column subquery
       select name, address from user_table where user_id in (select user_id from invoice table where paid = false)
       ''
     - Added support for left outer join (Github/backpaper0)

    date: 2012-01-27

    fixes:
     - Fixed default String value bug where a default empty string threw an IndexOutOfBounds exception
}

# 0.7.9 release
#
r16: {
    title: Iciql 0.7.9 released
    id: 0.7.9
    date: 2012-01-24

    additions:
     - ''
       Added toParameter() option for SET commands and allow generating parameterized UPDATE statements

       String q = db.from(t).set(t.timestamp).toParameter().where(t.id).is(5).toSQL();
       db.executeUpdate(q, new Date());
       ''

#
# 0.7.8 release
#
r15: {
    title: Iciql 0.7.8 released
    id: 0.7.8
    date: 2012-01-11
    fixes:
     - Replaced non-threadsafe counter used for assigning AS identifiers in JOIN statements with an AtomicInteger
     - Prevent negative rollover of the AS counter
     - Fixed bug in Query.select(Z z) which assumed that Z must always be an anonymous inner class which may not always be true.  This allows for specifying an existing alias to force table or identifier usage in the generated select list.  This is very useful for DISTINCT JOIN statements where only the columns of the primary table are of interest.

    additions:
     - Added optional alias parameter to Query.toSQL and QueryWhere.toSQL to force generated statement to prefix an AS identifier or, alternatively, the tablename.  
     - Query.toSQL(boolean distinct, K alias)
     - QueryWhere.toSQL(boolean distinct, K alias)
}

#
# 0.7.7 release
#
r14: {
    title: Iciql 0.7.7 released
    id: 0.7.7
    date: 2012-01-05
    changes:
     - ''
       Disallow declaring and explicitly referencing multiple instances of an enum type within a single model.

       A runtime exception will be thrown if an attempt to use where/set/on/and/or/groupBy/orderBy(enum) and your model has multiple fields of a single enum type.
       ''

    additions:
     - added Query.toSQL() and QueryWhere.toSQL() methods which, when combined with the following new methods, allows for generation of a parameterized, static sql string to be reused with a dynamic query or a PreparedStatement.
     - QueryCondition.isParameter()
     - QueryCondition.atLeastParameter()
     - QueryCondition.atMostParameter()
     - QueryCondition.exceedsParameter()
     - QueryCondition.lessThanParameter()
     - QueryCondition.likeParameter()
     - QueryCondition.isNotParameter()
}

#
# 0.7.6 release
#
r13: {
    title: Iciql 0.7.6 released
    id: 0.7.6
    date: 2011-12-21
    changes:
     - Iciql now tries to instantiate a default value from an annotated default value IFF the field object is null, it is specified nullable = false, and a defaultValue exists.  This only applies to db.insert or db.update.
}

#
# 0.7.5 release
#
r12: {
    title: Iciql 0.7.5 released
    id: 0.7.5
    date: 2011-12-12
    fixes:
     - Iciql now identifies wildcard queries and builds a dynamic column lookup.  Otherwise, the original field-position-based approach is used.  This corrects the performance regression released in 0.7.4 while still fixing the wildcard statement column mapping problem.
}

#
# 0.7.4 release
#
r11: {
    title: Iciql 0.7.4 released
    id: 0.7.4
    date: 2011-12-06

    fixes:
     - Fixed JOIN ON primitives
     - Fixed GROUP BY primitives
     - Fixed primitive references when selecting into a custom type with primitives
     - ''
       Fixed inherited JaQu bug related to model classes and wildcard queries (select *).

       Iciql maps resultset columns by the index of the model class field from a list.  This assumes that all columns in the resultset have a corresponding model field definition.  This works fine for most queries because iciql explicitly selects columns from the table (select alpha, beta...) when you execute select().
       The problem is when iciql issues a dynamic wildcard query and your model does not represent all columns in the resultset: columns and fields may fail to correctly line-up.

       Iciql now maps all fields by their column name, not by their position.
       ''

    changes:
     - Disallow declaring and explicitly referencing multiple primitive booleans in a single model.  A runtime exception will be thrown if an attempt to use where/set/on/and/or/groupBy/orderBy(boolean) and your model has multiple mapped primitive boolean fields.

    additions:
     - Added list alternatives to the varargs methods because it was too easy to forget list.toArray()
     - Db.executeQuery(Class<? extends T> modelClass, String sql, List<?> args)
     - Db.executeQuery(String sql, List<?> args)
     - Query.where(String fragment, List<?> args)
}

}

#
# 0.6.6 release
#
r6: {
    title: Iciql 0.6.6 released
    id: 0.6.6
    date: 2011-08-15
    changes:
     - Disabled two concurrency unit tests since I believe they are flawed and do not yield reproducible results
    additions:
    - Implemented HSQLDB MERGE syntax.  HSQL 2.2.4 fails 1 test which is bug-3390047 in HSQLDB.
    - Added Derby database dialect.  Derby 10.7.1.1 and 10.8.1.2 pass 100% of tests.

#
r4: {
    title: Iciql 0.6.4 released
    id: 0.6.4
    date: 2011-08-12
    fixes:
     - do not INSERT primitive autoIncrement fields, let database assign value
    changes:
     - @IQTable.createIfRequired -> @IQTable.create
     - unspecified length String fields are now CLOB instead of TEXT.  dialects can intercept this and convert to another type. e.g. MySQL dialect can change CLOB to TEXT.
    - java.lang.Boolean now maps to BOOLEAN instead of BIT
    - expressions on unmapped fields will throw an IciqlException
    - expressions on unsupported types will throw an IciqlException
    - moved dialects back to main package
    - moved create table and create index statement generation into dialects
    - renamed _iq_versions table to iq_versions since leading _ character is troublesome for some databases
    - @IQColumn(allowNull=true) -> @IQColumn(nullable=true)
    - All Object columns are assumed NULLABLE unless explicitly set @IQColumn(nullable = false)
    - All Primitive columns are assumed NOT NULLABLE unless explicitly set @IQColumn(nullable = true)
    - changed @IQTable.primaryKey definition to use array of column names (@IQTable( primaryKey = {"name", "nickname"}) )

    additions:
     - full support for primitives in all clauses
     - DECIMAL(length, scale) support
     - improved exception reporting by including generated statement, if available 
     - improved automatic dialect determination on pooled connections
     - added HSQL dialect.  HSQL fails 4 out of 50 unit tests. (2 failures are unimplemented merge, 1 is a bug-3390047 in HSQLDB, 1 is a concurreny issue)
     - added untested MySQL dialect
     - allow defining table create DEFAULT values from default object values (Date myDate = new Date(100, 1, 1); => CREATE TABLE ... myDate DATETIME DEFAULT '2000-02-01 00:00:00')
